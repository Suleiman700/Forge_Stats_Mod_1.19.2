## Mining Helper

A simple forge mod to help players with mining.

This mod works in single-player, multi-player & realms.

### How Does It Work:

When enabled, It will search for all blocks around you (in radios of 10) and will send you a chat that contains blocks coordinates (only visible to you).

This mod will give you ***Night Vision*** for almost one minute to help you :)
